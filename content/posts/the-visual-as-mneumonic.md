excerpt: Is visualization just another shortcut to access much data?

Visualizing is a powerful experience, unlike a linear read, One is presented with an entire picture. I typically find a figure daunting at first. Which part did the drawer want me to focus on? where should i be looking? am I getting what I need to be from this drawing?

<pre><code class="language-css">p { color: red }</code></pre>

Those are probably more intension oriented questions
